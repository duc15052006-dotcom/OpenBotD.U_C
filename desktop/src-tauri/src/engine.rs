//! The container engine: find one, install one, and prove it answers.
//!
//! Everything here was learned by running the stack on all three platforms rather than from the
//! documentation, and the three differ more than they look:
//!
//! - **macOS.** `podman machine` puts a Linux VM behind a socket. Inside that VM
//!   `/var/run/docker.sock` is already a symlink to the rootless socket, so Compose's mount needs no
//!   help and `ENGINE_SOCKET` stays unset. `applehv` is the default on Apple silicon as of Podman
//!   6.1, so no `--provider` is passed.
//! - **Linux.** Podman is native and rootless and there is no VM. `/var/run/docker.sock` is either
//!   absent or, with `podman-docker` installed, a symlink to the *rootful* socket, which is not the
//!   one running. `ENGINE_SOCKET` has to name `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/podman/podman.sock` or the
//!   supervisor is handed a dead socket and reports that it cannot reach Docker.
//! - **Windows.** `podman machine` again, on WSL2, and the same in-VM symlink as macOS. WSL refuses
//!   to run as LocalSystem, so none of this can be done from a service; see `windows.rs`.
//!
//! A second rule was learned the same way: **never assume the engine is on this process's PATH.**
//! When OpenBot installs Podman itself, the installer extends the *user's* PATH, and this process
//! was started with the old one. `podman` then cannot be run for the rest of the session, so the
//! app reports no engine while `podman.exe` sits on disk where it was just put. Every engine
//! command is therefore built from a resolved path, and the Compose provider OpenBot placed is put
//! on the child's PATH. See `install.rs`.
//!
//! One rule cuts across all three: **never address Podman through its ambient default connection.**
//! `podman` sends every command to whichever machine is marked default, and that machine belongs to
//! whoever made it. A person with a stopped machine of their own gets `Cannot connect to Podman`
//! from a machine of ours that is running perfectly well, which reads as our bug and is unfixable
//! from the error. So the engine is carried as an `Address` and every invocation names its
//! connection. Managed Docker runs likewise pin their effective context or host before Compose up.
