/**
 * A tool call nobody answered does not end the conversation.
 *
 * A call the surface owns ends the run without a result on purpose: the surface draws it, or puts it
 * to a person, and starts the next run carrying the answer. When nobody answers — a Bot asks for the
 * wheel to get past a sign-in and the person decides they do not need it after all — no answer is
 * ever carried, and the call sits in the history with nothing following it.
 *
 * OpenAI rejects that on the NEXT turn: "an assistant message with 'tool_calls' must be followed by
 * tool messages responding to each 'tool_call_id'". So the conversation was not stuck on that one
 * request, it was finished: every later message failed identically, and the only way out was a new
 * conversation, which loses this one.
